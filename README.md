ASCENT ACADEMY WEATHER APP
This is  simply a fully responsive weather app built using  the Streamlit Library of Pythom which frees up time to build a fast backend. Taking about the features of this system, it uses the Openweathermap API to fetch the data from the server and then render it on the  user side . The user can write down the name of any city across the world in the app then the user can get  the condition of the current-day climate probability and predict whether the day is a cloudy or sunny day. 

To run this App make sure you are using the latest version of python.(Python 3.x)
